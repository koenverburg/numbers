# Numbers
This is more of a showcase repository, In which I will collect all the ci/cd times from my most active repositories. Because in our world the numbers that matter are ci durations.
Using git I can also track possible problems with durations getting longer over time or shorter with optimizations.

Right now I have 4 repositories which deploy to Netlify in about 3m 15s.
